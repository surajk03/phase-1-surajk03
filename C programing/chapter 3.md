# Loops


> The repetition of some portion of program either a specified number of times or until a particular condition is being satisfied is called loops.

> the repetitive operation is done through a **loop control instruction.**

**Loop control instruction:** the loop control instruction helps the computer to execute group of statements repeatedly.

The three methods by which we can repeat a part of program are:

1. for statement.
2. while statement.
3. do-while statement.


## While loop

The general form of while loop is:

```
while (condition)
     {
       set of statements;
       either increment/decrement;
     }
```     

**Note:**

1. Until the condition is true, the set of statements get executed repeatedly.
